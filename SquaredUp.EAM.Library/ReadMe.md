**Enterpise Application Monitoring Library**

The Enterprise Application Monitoring library doesn't make any changes to your environment, but is required for Squared Up 4's Enterprise Applications.

While you can import this management pack without Squared Up version 4, it will have no effect aside from allowing you to define your own EAs manually.
