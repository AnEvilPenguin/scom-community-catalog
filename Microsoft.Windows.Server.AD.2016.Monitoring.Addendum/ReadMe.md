### SCOM AD Directory Services Addendum

This Addendum MP will add Recovery tasks to AD DS Service Monitors. 

The Pack has 12 Recovery tasks for DFS, NTDS, DFSR, IsmServ, KDC, NetLogon, NTFRS, W32Time, Group Policy, DNS Client, ADWS, and DNS.

The recovery tasks verify service state, start 'not running' services, and recalculate health. 

This will avoid common rework if/when services go down.
